# 6.4 Moment generating functions

---

#### generating function?

* powerful tool, bridging between sequences of numbers and the world of claculus.
* In probability, discrete 또는 continuous distribution을 살펴보는데에 굉장히 유용하다

#### General idea of a generating function

​    a sequence of numbers &rarr; a generating function &rarr; encode a sequence

#### Moment generating function

​    어떤 distribution의 moments를 encode.

> **Definition**. (Moment generating function). The moment generating function (MGF) of an r.v. X is

> $M(t) = E(e^{tX})$, as a function of t, if this is finite on some open interval (−a, a) containing 0. Otherwise we say the MGF of X does not exist.
